# Blockchain_demo
## This is a demonstration of how the blockchain technology works under the hood.
### It demonstrates;
- [x] How the genesis block is initiated 
- [x] How hashing of the block is done using SHA256
- [x] How a transcation is initiated in the blockchain
- [x] How the transcation is held when validation is happening(pending state).
- [x] How the transcation is recorded
- [x] How a new block is created and the hash of the previous block is added to it as asecurity measure.
### The hash library iterates a number of times in order to match a given hashing criteria(the first 3 characters of the hash must begin with '000'). The nonce property shows the number of iterations that has happened to get the correct hash.
